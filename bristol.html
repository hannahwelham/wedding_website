        <h2>venue...</h2>
          <p>With Bristol's harbour always in our hearts, we're getting married on <a href="http://www.glassboat.co.uk/">the Glassboat</a> on Saturday 19th December. The restaurant can be found on Welsh Back, next to Bristol Bridge (BS1 4SB, map below). Please arrive between 4.30 and 4.45pm, and come midnight we'll have as many taxis as possible waiting to get you to your beds.</p>
          <p>The whole wedding will be on the boat, with no outdoor photos, so no need to venture into the December cold again once you're with us. Any sea-sickness sufferers will also be glad to hear that the venue is permanently moored!</p>
          <p>London visitors might recognise the 'Piano Man', who will be on the keys for the evening and does a mean job covering classics old and new. So come armed with your dancing shoes and song requests!</p>
          <p>One quick PS for the girls - don't worry about bringing any confetti (all will become clear)!</p>

            <p>If you need to book a taxi at any point over the weekend, we recommend <a href="http://v-cars.com/bristol.php">V Cars</a> (0117 925 2626) or the <a href="https://get.uber.com/go/">Uber app</a>. V Cars do tend to get booked up on Saturday evenings, so make sure to call ahead.</p>
            <p>Free parking is limited in the city centre but there is an NCP on Queen Charlotte Street (BS1 4ES), and paid on-street parking at Queen Square (BS1 4QS). Both are a couple of minutes' walk from the Glassboat. There are also numerous car parks in the city centre, and free spots in residential areas such as Southville, Clifton and Redland.</p>
            <p>Bristol's bus station is located on Marlborough Street (BS1 3NU), convenient for city centre accommodation and 10 minutes' walk from the wedding venue. <a href="http://www.nationalexpress.com/home.aspx">National Express</a> run regular coaches to and from the city.</p>

            <p>If you're <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">travelling by train</a>, we recommend heading to Temple Meads station, which is a straightforward 15-minute walk or five-minute taxi ride from the venue and city centre. There are always plenty of taxis at the station, so no need to book in advance.</p>

            <p>For anyone flying to Bristol, there is a good taxi rank at the airport but the <a href="http://flyer.bristolairport.co.uk">Flyer bus service</a> is fantastic, running every 10 minutes with advance or on-the-day tickets for just over a tenner. For the city centre, get off at Temple Meads train station or the coach station.</p>
